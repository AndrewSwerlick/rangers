# Overview

The assault phase is the core tactical heart of the game. It's the crunchy phase, where players make decisions to fend off the aliens, the tension racheting up as the waves increase in size and danger. 

## Assault Phase Structure 

The assault phase considers of two alternating parts, wave defense followed by recover. Wave defense is when the GM controls the wave as it moves through the map and the rangers attempt to defend against it. Recovery is when rangers get a brief moment to regroup after defeating a wave to heal themselves, restore obstacles, and prepare for the next waves. 

### The Wave Turn

The wave is the representation of the enemy forces assaulting the base. Waves are composed of the following characteristics 

* Momentum Pool - The momentum pool represents the ability of the wave to actively attack and assault the base. As the wave moves through the park, attacking rangers, being attacked, taking locations, the wave loses momentum. When it's momentum hits zero, the wave ends and the recovery period begins
* Tokens - The tokens are the physical representation of a wave on the board. The number of tokens is a factor of the momentum pool. Momentum / 3 rounded up. So 10-12 momentum = 4 tokens; 7-9 momentum = 3 tokens; etc. Each token can be individually moved along roads, assault locations, etc. 
* Archetype & Capabilities - At the start of each wave round, the GM will select, or opt to roll at random, the archetype of the wave. Archetype's represent different kinds of waves, with different capabilities. Each archtype has special moves, available to it, special weaknesses, and other unique features

Each turn the GM controls the wave, performing actions from the wave's move sets as described in [Wave Turn](./wave_turn.md). The wave is aiming to achieve an objective, established in the prep phase of the game. The GM can perform one action per token, with the limitation that groups of tokens at the same location, must act together, and cannot stack their actions.

### Ranger Turns 

After the wave turn, rangers go according to the [Ranger Turn](./ranger_turns.md). 

### Recovery Phase 

Once the wave momentum hits zero, we immediately enter the recovery phase. The GM explains how the wave slows their assault and consolidates their location wins. Each ranger is given 1 recovery point to spend. The player has the following options to spend this point 

1. Recover 1 injury 
2. Wipe away 1 exhaustion 
3. Restore one trap or obstacle 
4. Get one token

Players are expected to narrate their choices, explain how they use the recovery period within the story.

### Transition to the desperation phase 

The GM decides when the game enters the desperation phase. Generally it's whenever it narratively makes sense. When the wave achieves whatever objective was established at the start of the narrative, or the rangers losses are too great. The GM shouldn't wait for the current wave to resolve, or for the rangers to finish their turn, instead they should immediately narrate how the wave overwhelms the rangers in this situation, and move into the collaborative story telling for the next phase, prompting the players for the details they need to setup the next part of the story, as covered in [Desperation Phase](./desperation_phase.md)

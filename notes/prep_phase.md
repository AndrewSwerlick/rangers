# The Rangers - Prep Phase Design

## Overview
The prep phase is a 30-45 minute collaborative worldbuilding session that serves triple duty: character creation, map setup, and rules explanation. Players build investment through narrative contribution while making tactical decisions that will shape the defense phase.

## Core Philosophy
The prep phase rewards engagement through a token economy. Players earn prep tokens by contributing to the collaborative story. These tokens can be spent immediately on defenses OR saved for heroic moments in Act 3 (Desperation phase).

## Three-Act Structure Context
- **Act 1 (Prep):** Earn tokens, OPTIONAL spending on defenses
- **Act 2 (Crisis, waves 1-3):** Earn tokens through adversity, CANNOT spend
- **Act 3 (Desperation, waves 4-5):** Spend freely on heroic moments

Players know this structure. The strategic tension in Act 1 is: invest in defenses now or save tokens for clutch heroic moments later?

## The Four Rounds

### Round 1: Character Creation
**Purpose:** Establish ranger identity and park backstory

**Mechanics:**
- Players fill out character/archetype sheets
- Sheets include choose-your-own prompts like:
  - "What were you running from when you came to the park?"
  - "Why did you leave the park and come back?"
  - "What do you keep in your personal locker at the ranger station?"
- Prompts can be universal or archetype-specific

**Token Economy:**
- Baseline: 1 token per prompt answered
- GM awards bonus tokens for particularly evocative or creative answers
- GM awards bonus tokens for yes-anding other players' contributions

---

### Round 2: Location Designation
**Purpose:** Assign mechanical roles to actual map locations with narrative justification

**Mechanics:**
- Total locations = 1.5x number of players (rounded as needed)
- GM assigns first, then players pick:
  1. **GM assigns:** Half the player count (rounded up) from the location pool, placing them at existing structures on the map
  2. **Players pick:** Each player chooses one location from the remaining pool and narrates where they're placing it and why
- Location sheets have prompts players must answer:
  - "Why did you fortify the visitor center?"
  - "What's the story behind the old fire tower's radio equipment?"
- Narrative explanation determines/justifies the location's mechanical role

**Token Economy:**
- 1 token per location designation (1 per player baseline)
- Bonus tokens for creative backstories
- Bonus tokens for connecting locations to other rangers' stories

**Design Note:** Locations are created similar to character creation - collaborative investment in the map itself.

---

### Round 3: Threat Discovery
**Purpose:** Collaboratively establish what the threat IS through individual perspectives

**Mechanics:**
- Pre-set sequential prompts that BUILD the threat layer by layer
- Go around the table, each player answering the next prompt:
  1. "When did you first start to suspect something bad was going to happen?"
  2. "What happened to convince you the threat was real?"
  3. "What did you find that revealed how bad it was?"
  4. "Who tried to warn you and what happened to them?"
  - (Exact prompts TBD, but structured to build escalating dread)

**Token Economy:**
- 1 token per answer
- Bonus tokens for yes-anding and building on others' contributions
- Bonus tokens for adding tension and stakes

**GM Role:**
- Synthesize narrative contributions into mechanical victory/loss conditions
- These conditions can be organic (emerge from what players described) rather than explicitly stated
- GM may roll for wave archetype here, or let narrative suggest which fits
- GM decides when to trigger Act 3 based on narrative/pacing, not rigid mechanical triggers

**Victory Condition Philosophy:** 
Conditions emerge from the collaborative fiction. GM may keep exact triggers somewhat ambiguous, maintaining tension and preventing players from gaming the system.

---

### Round 4: Preparation & Response
**Purpose:** Spend prep tokens on tactical defenses OR save them for Act 3

**Mechanics:**
- Simple prompt: "What are you doing to prepare for the threat?"
- Players describe preparations narratively
- GM assigns costs and benefits based on scope/investment
- Group discusses and commits to purchases
- Any unspent tokens are saved for Act 3

**Available Defenses:**
Players don't see this as a menu - they describe what they want to do, GM references this chart:

**Traps** (placed on road segments, one-time use)
- 2 tokens: Standard trap (2 momentum damage, stops advancement)
- 3 tokens: Enhanced trap (3 momentum damage, stops advancement)
- 4 tokens: Devastating trap (4 momentum damage, stops advancement, possibly removes token)

**Barricades** (placed on road segments, can be manned or unmanned)
- 2 tokens: Basic barricade (standard mechanics)
- 3 tokens: Reinforced barricade (takes 2 wave turns to destroy, or better when manned)
- 4 tokens: Fortress barricade (+1 to breach defense when manned, or other benefit)

**Location Fortification** (improves defensive capability)
- 3 tokens: +1 defensive bonus
- 5 tokens: +2 defensive bonus
- 6+ tokens: +2 bonus plus special ability (GM discretion)

**GM Flexibility:**
- Costs can be adjusted based on token budget and narrative scope
- Creative ideas get GM adjudication using these as guidelines
- "I'm carefully positioning spike traps to funnel them into a killzone" might justify lower cost
- Players can invest MORE in specific defenses for greater impact

**Strategic Choices:**
- Spread tokens thin (many weak defenses, broad coverage)
- Concentrate tokens (fewer strong defenses at key points)
- Save most/all tokens for Act 3 (risky but valid - weak defenses, epic finale)

**Note on Choke Points:** 
Choke points are NOT prep purchases. They're natural terrain features that rangers use opportunistically during Act 2 for ambushes. They're about tactical positioning during defense, not pre-built structures.

## Token Economy Guidelines for GMs

### Earning Tokens (Rounds 1-3)
**Baseline:** 1 token per meaningful contribution
- Each prompt answered = 1 token
- Each location designated = 1 token

**Bonus tokens** (GM discretion) for:
- Particularly evocative or creative descriptions
- Yes-anding that builds on others' ideas
- Establishing connections between characters/locations
- Adding tension or stakes to the threat
- Surprising or emotionally resonant answers

**Expected Budget:**
For 4 players across 4 rounds:
- Baseline: ~8-12 tokens (2-3 per player)
- With bonuses: ~12-16 tokens
- Adjust wave starting momentum in playtesting to balance

### Spending Tokens (Round 4)
**No minimum spend required** - groups can save everything for Act 3 if they want
- Groups that spend heavily: stronger tactical position, fewer heroic moment resources
- Groups that save: weaker defenses, more dramatic Act 3
- Most groups will find a balance

**Philosophy:** There's no "winning" or "losing" this game. It's about creating a satisfying three-act story. Groups that skip prep or min-max just get a less emotionally resonant experience.

# Obstacle Types & Mechanics

## Overview
Rangers establish obstacles during the prep phase to control wave movement, deal damage, and create defensive advantages. Each obstacle type has distinct mechanics and tactical purposes.

---

## Trap (Always Unmanned)

### Setup
- Rangers place during prep phase on specific road segment
- Limited number available (TBD - possibly role-dependent)
- Invisible to wave until triggered
- One-time use

### Wave Encounters Trap

**When wave advances through trapped road segment:**

1. **Trap triggers automatically** (cannot be avoided or bypassed)
2. **Wave takes 2 momentum damage** (fixed)
   - Certain ranger roles can increase to 3 damage
3. **Wave's advancement stops** (must regroup)
4. **Trap is removed** (one-time use, no longer on map)

**Next wave turn:**
- Wave must use another advancement to continue
- Lost both momentum and time

### Tactical Use
- **Best placement:** On likely approach routes
- **Purpose:** Automatic damage + delay
- **Trade-off:** One-time use, then gone
- **Synergy:** Pairs well with choke points (soften wave before ambush)

---

## Barricade (Can be Manned or Unmanned)

### Setup
- Rangers place during prep phase on road segment
- Physical obstacle (debris, fortifications, improvised walls)
- Can be manned by ranger for enhanced defense
- Persists until destroyed

---

### Unmanned Barricade

**Wave encounters unmanned barricade:**

**Wave's advancement stops**

**Wave must destroy barricade:**
- Use wave's capability slot to destroy
- No momentum cost
- Takes entire wave turn
- Barricade removed, wave can advance next turn

**No bypass options** (baseline) - some archetypes might have bypass capability as special ability

### Tactical Purpose
- **Pure delay:** Forces wave to spend time destroying
- **No choices:** GM doesn't make tactical decisions, just stops and destroys
- **Tempo disruption:** Slows wave advance predictably

---

### Manned Barricade

**Wave encounters manned barricade:**

**Uses standard breach mechanics** (same as defending a location)

**Ranger rolls d6:**
- **1-3:** Repelled
  - Wave loses 1 + bonuses momentum
  - Barricade holds
  - No harm to ranger
  
- **4-5:** Contested
  - Wave loses 1 + bonuses momentum
  - Ranger chooses harm:
    - Take injury (barricade holds)
    - Exhaustion - lose 1d6 (barricade holds)
    - Abandon barricade (retreat unharmed, barricade cleared)
  
- **6:** Breakthrough
  - Wave loses 1 + bonuses momentum
  - Ranger must retreat to adjacent location (or captured if unable)
  - **Barricade is cleared** (no additional cost or time)
  - Wave can continue advancing

### Key Features

**When ranger abandons or is driven off:**
- Barricade is immediately cleared (no extra turn/cost needed)
- Wave can continue advancing
- Value was in the defensive fight, not physical obstacle

**Can hold multiple rounds:**
- Designed for sustained defense
- Ranger can keep choosing injury/exhaustion on 4-5 to hold position
- Much more sustainable than choke points

### Tactical Use
- **Manned:** Sustainable defensive position for momentum drain
- **Purpose:** Force wave to spend momentum breaking through
- **Trade-off:** Requires ranger commitment, but can hold long-term
- **Best for:** Critical junctions protecting key locations

---

### Wave Encounters Manned Choke Point (First Time)

**Wave advancement stops**

**Wave takes automatic ambush damage:**
- 1 + ranger bonuses momentum
- Represents successful ambush/suppressing fire
- No roll required

**Wave counter-attacks (ranger rolls d6):**
- **1-5:** Counter-attack fails
  - Ranger is safe
  - Can stay at choke point
  
- **6:** Counter-attack succeeds
  - Ranger chooses harm:
    - Take injury (can stay)
    - Exhaustion - lose 1d6 (can stay)

### Ranger's Next Turn Decision

**Stay or go:**
- **Leave:** Move away using standard action (choke point becomes unmanned)
- **Stay:** Hold position for another round (high risk)

---

### Wave Assaults Choke Point (If Ranger Stayed)

**If ranger is still at choke point on subsequent wave turn:**

**Wave assaults the exposed position**

**Ranger rolls d6:**
- **1:** Safe
  - Wave loses 1 + bonuses momentum
  - Ranger can stay (but why?)
  
- **2-4:** Forced choice
  - Wave loses 1 + bonuses momentum
  - Ranger chooses harm:
    - Take injury (can stay)
    - Exhaustion - lose 1d6 (can stay)
  
- **5-6:** Captured
  - Ranger is captured
  - Choke point becomes unmanned (just terrain)

**Risk assessment:**
- 67% chance (2-6) of consequences
- 33% chance (5-6) of capture
- Message: Don't overstay at choke points!

### Tactical Use
- **Purpose:** Hit-and-run harassment, guerrilla tactics
- **Best use:** Ambush once, deal damage, retreat
- **High risk/reward:** Can deal damage multiple rounds but extreme capture risk
- **Mobile:** Can reposition and set up new ambush elsewhere

---

## Obstacle Comparison

| Obstacle Type | Manned? | Damage Type | Wave Cost to Clear | Best Use |
|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Trap** | Never | 2 momentum (auto) | N/A (auto-triggers) | Automatic delay + damage on key routes |
| **Barricade (unmanned)** | Optional | None | 1 turn (no momentum) | Pure delay, tempo disruption |
| **Barricade (manned)** | Optional | 1-3 momentum (breach roll) | Cleared when ranger leaves | Sustained defense, momentum drain |
| **Choke Point** | Must be | 1+ momentum (auto ambush) | Cleared when ranger leaves | Hit-and-run, mobile harassment |

---

## Strategic Considerations

### For Rangers During Prep

**Trap Placement:**
- High-probability approach routes
- Before important positions (soften wave before engagement)
- Limited quantity - must choose carefully

**Barricade Placement:**
- Critical junctions
- Protecting key locations
- Where you plan to make a stand

**Choke Point Identification:**
- Natural terrain advantages
- Fallback positions for harassment
- Escape routes that can be ambushed

### For Waves (GM)

**Against Traps:**
- Unavoidable - just take the damage and delay
- Can't be bypassed or mitigated (baseline)
- Costs 2 momentum + 1 turn

**Against Unmanned Barricades:**
- Simple - just stop and destroy next turn
- No tactical choices, pure delay
- No momentum cost

**Against Manned Barricades:**
- Momentum drain through breach attempts
- Consider how much momentum you'll lose vs. bypassing
- Once ranger driven off, immediately cleared

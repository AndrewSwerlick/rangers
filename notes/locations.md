# General Location Rules 

Each location has 2 bonuses, a Defense Bonus and a Recovery Bonus. 

Defense bonuses are available during the assault phase, so long as the location is manned. Recovery Bonuses are available during the recovery phase as long as a location is not captured. To get the recovery bonus you must spend a recovery point.


## The Campground
- Defense Bonus: Civilian Recruits - The civilians here step up to defend their home. Breach rolls at this location are made with one extra die.
- Recovery Bonus: It's a Trap! - A group of civilians agree to draw the aliens into an ambush. Gain one ambush token. As an action, any ranger may spend this token to move any wave token one segment in any direction.

## The Boathouse
- Special Considerations: Must be placed along water.
- Defense Bonus: Water Routes - The waterways are your secret highway. Rangers may move from this location along the water to any connected point as if it were a trail.
- Recovery Bonus: Getaway Vehicle - You hide a boat just where you need it. Gain one boat token. Any ranger may spend this token to enter the water and move along it to any connected point as if it were a trail.

## The Firetower
- Defense Bonus: A Clear Route - From up here, you can spot safe passages through enemy lines. As long as this location is manned, any ranger may move through wave-controlled roads as a risky action.
- Recovery Bonus: Advanced Intel - Your vantage point reveals exactly how they're approaching. At the start of the next wave, the rangers choose where all wave tokens spawn.

## The Dam
- Defense Bonus: Narrow Spillway - The wave struggles to cross the narrow bridge path. When the wave assaults this location, they take +1 momentum damage, even on failed defense rolls.
- Recovery Bonus: Controlled Release - You figure out how to manipulate the water flow. Gain one flood token. As an action, any ranger may spend this token to flood a road segment, making it impassable for 1 turn. Wave tokens on that road take 2 momentum damage.

## The Fortress
- Defense Bonus: Fortified Location - These walls were built to last. Breach defense rolls at this location get +1 to the result.
- Recovery Bonus: Bunker Down - You hunker behind thick walls and catch your breath. All rangers recover one exhaustion.

## The Ranger Station
- Defense Bonus: Coordinated Defense - The comms equipment lets you direct the defense. As an action, pick two locations or manned obstacles. The next breach roll at each is made with an extra die.
- Recovery Bonus: Triage - The station's medical supplies patch everyone up. All rangers recover one injury level.

## The Research Center
- Defense Bonus: Historical Archives - The archives hold knowledge about this land and its threats. As an action, allow a ranger who just acted to re-roll any failed die.
- Recovery Bonus: Survey Data - You study old maps and discover a forgotten path. Gain one hidden trail token. As an action, any ranger may spend this token to create a trail connection between any two locations for the rest of the wave.

## The Armory
- Defense Bonus: Jury Rigged Fortification - Spare parts and ingenuity go a long way. As an action, place a fortification on an adjacent road segment not controlled by the wave.
- Recovery Bonus: Quick Repairs - Everything you need to patch things up is right here. Restore 2 obstacles instead of 1.

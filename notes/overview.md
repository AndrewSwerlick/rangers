# The Rangers - TTRPG Design Document

## Core Concept
Post-apocalyptic TTRPG set in former state/national parks that serve as humanity's last safe havens. Players are rangers defending these parks against threats. 

## Setting Elements
- Alien invasion as catalyst for apocalypse
- Strange/supernatural phenomena
- Enigmatic powerful aliens with unknown agendas
- Mutated animals
- Threatening human factions
- Parks managed by loose affiliation of rangers serve as safe havens

## Design Philosophy
- One-shot focused (not campaigns)
- Narratively focused on dealing with overwhelming odds, and inevitable failure, but finding a way to save something and act heroically in spite of it all
- Mechanically, designed to feel like a tower defense game, with waves of increasingly powerful enemies
- Real park maps as core mechanical component
- Narrative and mechanical aspects are tied together with a token economy. Narrative moements are rewarded with tokens that players can spend under certain conditions

## Game Structure

### 3 Act Structure

**Prep Phase**
- Single preparation period before enemies arrive
- Players collaboratively narrate their backstory, the lore of the park, and the nature of the incoming threat, objectives of the wave, receiving tokens for their contributions
- Mechanically, players spend these tokens to arrange park defenses.

**Crisis Phase**
- Enemy arrives in waves
- Each wave contains a "momentum" value the rangers must burn down through attacks, and defense
- Alternating turns: Wave acts → All rangers respond
- Rangers have opportunities to earn tokens for narrative moments or failures in combot
- Mini-prep phases between waves (repositioning, recovery, repairs)
- Continue until waves overwhelm rangers and objectives established in Prep are lost

**Heroic Desperation Phase** 
- Players narrate a new secondary objective, based on prompts from the GM
- Mechanics shift, enemies stop arriving in waves, instead constant reinforcements as rangers disrupt existing enemies
- Rangers can now opt to spend tokens for heroic abilities that were previously locked
- Narrative the game becomes about reckless sacrifice, and big moments to achieve the secondary objective

## Map & Location System

### Real Park Maps
- Actual state/national park maps serve as game board
- Trail networks derived directly from real park topology
- Physical positioning matters tactically

### Location Creation
- Similar to character creation process
- Players assign roles to actual map locations (e.g., "The Fortress", "The Hideout")
- Locations have mechanical features and abilities
- Rangers can use location abilities when positioned there

### Movement & Trails
- **On-trail movement:** Safe, automatic success (costs 1 standard action)
- **Off-trail movement:** Risky action (requires d6 roll)
  - Movement must be done within standard action pool (can't be your risky 3rd action)
  - Trail network creates strategic corridors and positioning decisions

## Wave System

### Wave Characteristics

**Momentum Pool**
- Determines wave resilience/how many successes needed to defeat
- Increases progressively, 10, 15, 25, 40, 65

**Wave Archetype**
- Determines wave's capabilities and behavior
- Examples: Swarm, Siege, Infiltrator, Corrupted, etc.
- Each archetype has specific abilities GM can use
- GM picks the archetype that makes the most sense for the narrative

### Turn Structure

**Each Round:**
1. **Wave Turn:** 
  * Wave tokens move along roads defined by map, until the next location or obstacle defined by the ranger
  * Wave tokens assault locations or obstacles to attempt to take them over
2. **Ranger Turns:** All rangers act (in order they choose)
3. Repeat until threat pool reaches 0

## Player Characters (Rangers)

### Archetype Count
- 4-6 strongly-defined ranger archetypes
- Each player controls one ranger

### Archetype Design Framework
- **Prep Phase contribution:** How they prepare locations, setup obstacles 
- **Defense Phase contribution:** Their tactical role
- **Location synergy:** Which location types amplify their abilities

### Everyone Contributes
- All archetypes can contribute in both prep and defense phases
- Some specialization is fine, but no archetype should be useless in either phase

---

## Action Economy & Mechanics

### Ranger Actions (During Waves)

3 Actions a turn

**Safe Actions (auto-succeed):**
- Move on-trail
- Hold to defend your current location
- Use your current location's ability
- Setup a choke point

**Risky Actions (require d6 roll):**
- Attack the wave (reduce threat pool)
- Move off-trail

**Risky Action Roll**
- 6 Complete success, no complications 
- 4-5 Mixed success, achieve objective, take injury
- 1-3 Failure, take injury

### Attacking Waves
On Sucess: 
- **Momentum reduction formula:** -1 momentum base
- **Bonuses:** Certain roles get +1, certain locations get +1, role+location combos get +2, so max is -3 momentum damage
---

## Injury System

### Injury Track (4 levels)
1. **First injury:** Superficial - no mechanical impact
2. **Second injury:** Impaired - all rolls with disadvantage (roll 2d6, take lower)
3. **Third injury:** Severe - disadvantage AND -1 to result
4. **Fourth injury:** Captured

### Captured

TODO: Captured mechanics TBD

### Recovery
- Between waves (mini-prep phase): Rangers can recover injuries, restore obstacles
- Certain abilities can help with recovery

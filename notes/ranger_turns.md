# Ranger Turn Structure

## Core Concept
Ranger turns use a simple action economy: **3 actions, chosen from a menu of safe or risky actions**. Complexity and tactical depth come from location abilities and ranger archetype abilities, not from complicated base actions.
---

## Action Economy

### Safe Actions
- Automatically succeed
- No roll required
- Choose from available safe actions

### Risky Action
- Requires rolling d6 dice pool
- **1-3:** Failure + consequence (harm, etc.)
- **4-5:** Success but take harm/complication
- **6:** Clean success


## Harm and Consequences 

Risky actions, and other challenges can lead to harm/consequences. 

Players can choose to take harm as injury or exhaustion

### Exhaustion
- All rangers start out with a 3 d6 dice pool 
- Exhaustion causes your dice pool to shrink, making risky actions riskier
- Minimum of 1 dice
### Injury track

**Healthy Ranger:**
- Full movement options
- Low capture risk

**1st Injury (Lost Off-Trail):**
- No bushwhacking
- Can still retreat via trails or roads
- Moderate capture risk if roads blocked

**2nd Injury (Lost Trails):**
- Can ONLY retreat via roads
- If roads are wave-controlled, cannot retreat = capture risk
- High vulnerability

**3rd Injury (Cannot Move):**
- Cannot retreat at all
- Rolling 6 = automatic capture
- MUST hold or be captured
- On 4-5, cannot choose "give up location" (can't leave)
- Forced to choose injury (→ captured) or exhaustion

## Movement Actions

### On Trails (Safe Action)
- Move as far as you want along connected trails
- **Never blocked by wave tokens** (ranger advantage)
- Can slip past wave-controlled areas
- Can retreat to safety without engaging
- Trail network is rangers' secret resource

### On Roads - Unoccupied (Safe Action)
- Move as far as you want along roads
- Good for repositioning when waves aren't present
- Faster/more direct than some trail routes
- **Cannot move through wave-controlled road segments**
  - Wave token controls:
    - Road segment it's currently on
    - Road segment ahead (even beyond obstacle blocking it)
    - From obstacle/intersection behind to obstacle/intersection ahead
- Must use trails to bypass OR go off-road OR engage the wave
- Wave presence creates large no-go zones

### Off-Trail/Bushwhacking (Risky Action)
- Can move in wilderness to adjacent road or trail
- Requires d6 roll (follows risky action outcomes)
- Direct cross-country movement
- For desperate situations when networks don't serve you

## Combat Actions

### Attack Wave (Risky Action)
**Always requires d6 roll:**
- **1-3:** Miss + take harm
- **4-5:** Hit but take harm/complication
- **6:** Clean hit, no harm

**On success (4-6):**
- Deal 1 + bonuses momentum damage
- Apply modifiers:
  - Certain ranger roles: +1
  - Certain locations: +1
  - Role + location synergy: +2

**Final damage = 1 + bonuses, Max 3 damage**

### Setup Chokepoint (Safe Action)

- Establishes a new chokepoint obstacle to slow the wave and sap it's momentum
---

## Location Actions

### Use Location Ability (Safe Action)
- Each designated location has unique abilities
- Can only use ability of your current location
- Automatically succeeds (safe action)
- Examples might include:
  - Call for intel/reconnaissance
  - Set trap on adjacent road
  - Fortify position
  - Heal/recover
  - Summon support

**Location abilities provide:**
- Tactical variety between positions
- Reason to move around the map
- Synergy with ranger archetypes
- Unique solutions to wave threats

---
## Hold Turn

If a ranger is currently in a position they want, they can opt to hold for their whole turn. If they do this then recieve one token, and are given a narrative  opportunity. The GM will ask them one question that will encourage them to explain more of their backstory, current motivations, etc.

## Defend Action (Reactive - Not Part of Your Turn)

### When Wave Attempts Breach
**Triggered when wave spends momentum to capture your location**

**You roll d6:**
- **1-3:** Location captured, you choose harm (injury OR forced retreat OR ?)
- **4-5:** Location captured, you choose harm, BUT wave pays extra momentum
- **6:** Breach blocked, location holds, wave loses spent momentum, no harm to you

**This is reactive:**
- Happens during wave turn, not your turn
- You're already positioned there
- Wave comes to you
- No action economy cost

## Typical Ranger Turn Examples

### Aggressive Turn
1. **Safe Action 1:** Move along trail forward position
2. **Safe Action 2:** Use location ability (set trap, fortify, etc.)
3. **Risky Action 3:** Attack the wave

### Defensive Turn
1. **Standard Action 1:** Move to reinforce threatened location
2. **Standard Action 2:** Use location ability to support
3. **Skip 3rd turn:** Stay safe, position for next turn

### Repositioning Turn
1. **Safe Action 1:** Move to new location via trails
2. **Safe Action 2:** Move again to final position
3. **Safe Action 3:** Setup a chokepoint obstacle** 

### Desperate Turn
1. **Risky Action 1:** Bushwhack to location(risky - requires roll)
2. **Safe Action 2:** Use location ability
3. **Risky Action 3:** Attack wave
4. **Result:** Two risky rolls this turn - high risk, high reward

## Turn Order

### During Wave Phase
1. **Wave acts** 
2. **All rangers take turns** (in order they choose)
3. Rangers can coordinate order based on tactical needs
4. Repeat until wave momentum reaches 0

### Ranger Coordination
- Rangers decide their action order each round
- Can adapt to what previous rangers accomplished
- Enables combo plays and tactical adaptation
- No fixed initiative system

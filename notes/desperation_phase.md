# Desperation Phase (Act 3) - Complete Design

## Overview
The Desperation Phase represents the final act where defenses have failed but rangers make one last stand for what matters most. Mechanics shift from "win the battle" to "what are you willing to sacrifice?" The wave becomes infinite pressure while rangers burn through finite token resources for heroic moments.

---

## Triggering Act 3

**Conditions:**
- Narrative objectives fall
- GM calls it based on dramatic pacing

**The Moment:**
GM narrates the failure/arrival and asks: "The defenses have failed. What now?"

---

## Three-Step Transition

### Step 1: Rock Bottom
**Purpose:** Explore emotional low point before the final push

**Process:**
- GM asks prompts, rangers answer in turn
- Pure character moment, no mechanical effects

**Example Prompts:**
- "What are you thinking about as the defenses crumble?"
- "What promise did you make that you're about to break?"
- "What would the person who brought you here think of you right now?"
- "What memory keeps surfacing as you catch your breath?"

**Token Economy:** No tokens earned - this is narrative setup

---

### Step 2: Finding Purpose
**Purpose:** Establish personal stakes for the final push

**Process:**
1. GM synthesizes Rock Bottom responses
2. GM presents the current situation and offers 2-4 possible secondary objectives
3. Each ranger picks what matters to THEM (can be shared or individual)

**Secondary Objective Examples:**
- Evacuate trapped civilians to safety
- Destroy the artifact/relay before they can activate it
- Hold a critical position to buy evacuation time
- Ensure a fallen comrade's sacrifice wasn't in vain
- Protect specific survivors/locations that still matter

**Key Design Point:** 
- No forced consensus
- Rangers can naturally align (multiple people pick same objective) 
- Or pursue different goals (creates coordination tension)
- Different objectives create interesting tactical and narrative choices

---

### Step 3: Strengthen Resolve
**Purpose:** Mechanical and narrative "second wind" before final battle

**Mechanics:**
Each ranger gets **3 recovery points** to spend:
- **Remove 1 injury:** 1 point
- **Clear 1d6 exhaustion (restore 1d6 to pool):** 1 point
- **Gain 1 token:** 1 point

**Example Allocations:**
- 2 injury removal + 1 exhaustion clear (heavy healing, tactical survival)
- 1 injury + 1 exhaustion + 1 token (balanced approach)
- 3 tokens (martyrdom build - embracing heroic sacrifice)
- 3 injury removals (if on death's door)
- 1 injury + 2 tokens (light healing, emphasize heroics)

**Narrative Requirement:**
As you allocate points, narrate:
- What your chosen objective means to you personally
- How you're pushing through your limits
- What you're drawing strength from
- How you're steeling yourself for what must be done

**Optional:** GM can award 1 bonus token for particularly powerful narration

## Act 3 Core Mechanics

### Wave Structure (Changed from Acts 1-2)

**Token-Based Infinite Pressure:**
- Initial spawn: Tokens appear at all park entrances
- **Constant reinforcement:** Every time rangers remove a token from the board, a new token immediately spawns at an entrance
- No momentum pool to deplete
- Wave pressure never truly stops

**Strategic Implications:**
- Can't "win" by depleting wave
- Combat is about creating space/time for objective completion
- Must choose which tokens to deal with (threaten objective vs general pressure)
- Removing tokens provides temporary relief, not progress toward victory

---

### Combat Framework (Same as Act 2)

**Regular Actions Still Work:**
- Rangers still have 3-action economy
- Safe actions (move on trails, use location abilities, setup choke points)
- Risky actions (attack wave, bushwhack)
- Standard attack: Roll for 1-3 momentum damage
- Still need 3-4 momentum damage to remove a token

**Key Difference:**
- Tokens removed are immediately replaced
- Combat is about *which* tokens and *when*
- Tactical prioritization over strategic depletion

---

### Desperation Moves (Unlocked in Act 3)

**Core Design:**
- Structured as move set with token costs
- Every move has mechanical effect + narrative requirement
- GM can veto if narrative doesn't support the fiction
- Only available during Act 3

**The Move Set:**

#### LAST STAND
**Cost:** 2 tokens  
**Mechanical:** Deal 3 momentum damage automatically (no roll), take 1 injury  
**Narrative:** Describe your desperate, reckless assault or the sacrifice you're making

#### ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE
**Cost:** 3 tokens  
**Mechanical:** Remove 1 token from board immediately  
**Narrative:** What natural disaster do you trigger? What part of the park are you destroying? What does this cost?

#### AGAINST ALL ODDS
**Cost:** 1 token  
**Mechanical:** Automatically succeed on any risky action  
**Narrative:** Describe the moment of clarity, burst of adrenaline, or what you're fighting for

#### HOLD THE LINE
**Cost:** 2 tokens  
**Mechanical:** Your location becomes impregnable for 1 full wave turn (all breach attempts automatically fail)  
**Narrative:** What are you fortifying with? What are you willing to lose to buy time?

#### NOT TODAY
**Cost:** 1 token  
**Mechanical:** Negate an injury you just took  
**Narrative:** How do you push through? What keeps you going?

#### THE LONG GOODBYE
**Cost:** 3 tokens + willing capture  
**Mechanical:** Remove 2 tokens from board  
**Narrative:** You're staying behind. Describe your final stand and what it accomplishes

## Strategic Choices

### Token Conservation vs Expenditure
Rangers enter Act 3 with finite tokens (saved from Acts 1-2 + Strengthen Resolve)

**Aggressive Spending:**
- Frequent desperation moves
- Faster, more dramatic action
- Shorter Act 3, explosive finale
- Higher risk of running out

**Conservative Play:**
- Rely on regular combat
- Slower, grindier action
- Longer Act 3, war of attrition
- Tokens for critical moments only

**Typical Pattern:**
- Mix of regular combat and desperation moves
- Escalating token expenditure as objectives near completion
- Final dramatic moments burn remaining tokens

### Coordination Decisions

**Shared Objectives:**
- Natural teamwork
- Clear coordination
- Combine efforts efficiently

**Different Objectives:**
- Tension over priorities
- "I need your help, but you have your own mission"
- Splitting the party risks
- More dramatic character moments

## Ending the Game

**Philosophy:** The game ends when the table agrees the story is told.

**No Mechanical Victory Conditions:**
- Don't define "you win when X"
- Trust the table to recognize narrative conclusion
- Mechanics create natural endpoints but don't force them

**Natural Endpoints Emerge Through:**
- Tokens depleting (running out of heroic moments)
- Rangers achieving/failing personal objectives organically
- Escalating sacrifices (captures, injuries, desperate last stands)
- Narrative reaching emotionally satisfying conclusion
- One ranger's dramatic final moment that feels like "the end"

**GM's Role:**
- Recognize when story feels complete
- Ask: "Does that feel like the end?"
- Don't force continuation if table is satisfied
- Don't cut short if one more beat is needed

**The Central Question:**
Not "did you win?" but "what did you save, and what did it cost?"

## Design Notes

### Why Act 3 Works Differently

**Mechanical Shift:**
- Acts 1-2: Depletable momentum pools (can "win" waves)
- Act 3: Infinite reinforcements (can't "win", only endure)
- Mirrors narrative shift from "defend successfully" to "hold out for what matters"

**Token Economy Payoff:**
- Tokens earned through narrative investment (Acts 1-2)
- Become mechanical power (Act 3)
- Finite resource creates urgency and meaningful choices
- Spending tokens = spending emotional/narrative investment

**Emotional Arc:**
- Rock Bottom: Acknowledge defeat
- Finding Purpose: Reframe victory
- Strengthen Resolve: Physical manifestation of determination
- Desperation Combat: Playing out the consequences

### Playtesting Considerations

**Token Balance:**
- Monitor typical token pools entering Act 3
- Adjust desperation move costs if needed
- Ensure rangers have enough for 3-5 major moments
- Too many tokens = trivializes challenges
- Too few tokens = can't create dramatic moments

**Pacing:**
- Act 3 should feel intense but not rushed
- 15-30 minutes typical duration
- GM should track energy and look for natural conclusion
- Better to end strong than drag out

**Player Agency:**
- Multiple objectives preserve individual character arcs
- Don't force "group victory" if individual moments work better
- Some rangers may complete objectives, others may sacrifice themselves
- All valid endings

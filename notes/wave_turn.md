# Wave Turn Structure

## Core Concept
Each wave turn consists of **advancing tokens** along the road network toward the objective, then **using capabilities** to overcome obstacles and locations encountered during that advance.

---

## Wave Turn Flow

### 1. Advance
**GM moves 1 or more tokens along roads**
- Tokens move on road network (not trails - trails are ranger-only)
- Movement continues until tokens hit obstacles or locations
- GM decides which tokens move and where (enables splitting/concentrating forces naturally)
- No movement speed mechanics - just positioning

### 2. Overcome
**GM uses capability to deal with obstacles/locations encountered**
- Capabilities determine HOW the wave deals with what it hits
- Different archetypes have different capabilities
- All capabilities involve either spending momentum, forcing rolls, or both

---

## Momentum (Dual Resource)

Wave momentum serves two purposes:

**For Rangers (Offense):**
- Reduce to 0 to eliminate the wave
- Rangers attack to damage momentum

**For GM (Offense):**
- Spend to capture locations
- Spend to overcome certain obstacles
- Wave that spends aggressively becomes easier to eliminate

**Strategic Tension:**
- Waves that focus on taking locations drain their momentum faster
- But locations lost = weakened defenses for future waves
- Rangers must decide what's worth defending vs. sacrificing

---

## Token Mechanics

### Token Count
**Tokens = Wave Momentum ÷ 3 (rounded up)**
- 10-12 momentum = 4 tokens
- 7-9 momentum = 3 tokens
- 4-6 momentum = 2 tokens
- 1-3 momentum = 1 token

### Token Placement
- Tokens spawn at park entrances (roads leading into park)
- Tokens represent distributed presence of wave across the map

### Token Removal
- Remove tokens when momentum crosses breakpoints
- Provides visual feedback of wave weakening

---

## Obstacles (Established in Prep Phase)

Rangers establish obstacles during prep to block wave advancement. Waves must overcome or bypass them.

### Obstacle Types & Costs

**Fortifications (Manned):**
- Requires breach attempt (like defended location)
- Defending ranger rolls d6:
  - 1-3: Fortification falls, ranger chooses harm
  - 4-5: Fortification falls, ranger chooses harm, wave is damaged by ranger using damage mechanics.
  - 6: Breach blocked, wave is damaged by ranger, using damage mechanics, no harm to ranger

**Traps:**
- Triggered when wave advances through
- Roll for automatic momentum damage (d4 or d6)
- One-time use, then removed
- Slows wave but doesn't permanently block

**Barricades/Debris:**
- Wave spends X momentum to clear
- OR spends 1 turn (uses capability slot) to destroy
- Simple blocking obstacle with predictable cost

**Chokepoints**
- Dynamic obstacles setup by position rangers during their turns
- Halts a wave and damages it's momentum, using damage mechanics
- Ranger must move next turn or risk being assaulted
---

## Location Captures

### Undefended Locations
**Wave spends X momentum to capture**
- Automatic success
- Token remains there holding location
- Reduces available momentum pool

### Defended Locations (Ranger Present)
**Wave attempts to breach**
**Defending ranger rolls d6:**
- **1-3:** Location captured, ranger chooses harm (injury OR forced_retreat OR exhaustion)
- **4-5:** Location captured, ranger chooses harm, BUT wave pays standard cost to acquire location + additional damage according to damage mechanics (+1 or +2)
- **6:** Breach blocked, location holds, wave takes momentum damage accoarding to mechanics

**Note:** Exact momentum costs (X value) to be determined through playtesting

# Breach Defense Mechanics

## Core Concept
When a wave attempts to capture a location defended by a ranger, the defending ranger rolls to resist. All breach attempts drain wave momentum, but the severity of consequences for the ranger varies by roll result. Well-defended locations can be extremely costly for waves to capture.

---

## Breach Attempt Process

### 1. Wave Declares Breach
- Wave must be at or adjacent to target location
- GM declares breach attempt on specific location

### 2. Defending Ranger Rolls d6
- Only applies if ranger is present at the location
- Roll determines outcome for both wave and ranger

### 3. Apply Momentum Loss
- If the ranger roll succeeds, the wave takes damage according to damage mechanics
- If location captured, wave pays additional momentum to secure it

---

## Breach Defense Roll Outcomes

### 1-3: Repelled
**Wave momentum loss:** 1 + bonuses
**Ranger consequences:** None
**Location status:** Holds (remains under ranger control)

The ranger successfully defends the position. The wave's assault is turned back, costing them momentum but gaining nothing.

### 4-5: Contested
**Wave momentum loss:** 1 + bonuses
**Ranger consequences:** Must choose harm (see menu below)
**Location status:** Depends on ranger's harm choice

The fighting is intense and costly for both sides. The ranger must make a difficult choice.

**Harm Menu:**
- **Take injury** - Advance on injury track, location holds
- **Exhaustion** - Lose 1d6 from dice pool, location holds  
- **Give up location** - Retreat unharmed, wave captures location (and pays +2 momentum to secure)

### 6: Breakthrough
**Ranger consequences:** MUST retreat to adjacent location
**Location status:** Captured by wave, pays cost to secure it

The wave breaks through the ranger's defense. The ranger is forced back.

**Ranger must retreat:**
- Move to adjacent location of ranger's choice (if possible)
- If ranger cannot retreat (see Capture rules below), ranger is captured

**Wave secures location:**
- After forcing retreat, wave pays +2 momentum to secure the location

## Complete Wave Turn Sequence

1. **GM advances 1 or more tokens** along roads toward objective
2. **Tokens encounter obstacles/locations** and stop
5. **Rangers respond** (all ranger turns happen)
6. **Repeat** until momentum pool reaches 0 or objective achieved
